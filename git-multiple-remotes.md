To be able to push to two remote at once you can do:

```
git remote set-url --add --push origin [remote1]
```

```
git remote set-url --add --push origin [remote2]
```

Be aware that the first comand overwrites the default remote. But you can add as many as you want. So you need to add your default remote too.
